# MechaCar Statistical Analysis in R

During the course of this module, I utlized the DPLYR library within R. I was able to design a linear model that predicted the MPG of MechaCar prototypes by using key data points such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, ground clearnance, etc. 

## The analysis consisted of the following 4 deliverables:

1. Performing/creating a multiple linear regression analysis that identified and determined which variable in the dataset predicted the MPG of MechaCar Prototypes. 
2. Collecting summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Resources:
1. Data Source: MechaCar_mpg.csv and Suspension_Coil.csv
2. Data Tools: tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2 and MechaCarChallenge.RScript.
3. Software: RStudio and R

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
We designed a linear model that predicted the MPG of the prototypes using both the summary() AND lm() functions. We had to use as mentioned earlier: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD as independent variables. As shown in the picture below - you can see a summary of the results and outputs.
